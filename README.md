This bundle combines the advantages of Symfony translation files and translations in the Pimcore admin backend.

This bundle reads standard symfony translation files in yaml format and migrates them to Pimcore translations. Changed Pimcore translations are not overwritten.

## Installation

Require via Composer

```shell
composer require teamneusta/pimcore-translation-migration-bundle
```

As this is a Pimcore bundle, enable and install it
```shell
bin/console pimcore:bundle:enable NeustaPimcoreTranslationMigrationBundle
bin/console pimcore:bundle:install NeustaPimcoreTranslationMigrationBundle
```

## Usage

This bundle provides a Symfony command that just executes the migration.

```shell
bin/console neusta:translations:migrate
```

## Configuration

There is no configuration available.

### Further development

Pipelines will tell you, when code does not meet our standards. To use the same tools in local development, take the Docker command from above with other scripts from the `composer.json`. For example:

* cs:check
* phpstan

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app pimcore/pimcore:PHP8.1-cli composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app pimcore/pimcore:PHP8.1-cli composer <composer-script>
```

Only supported on Linux.
